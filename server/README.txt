General documentation for "server" files. Will be improved later.

The Server Application:
  The server application and the server file have been separated to facilitate testing the app without fully
    launching the server. Only the code in index.js should need to be modified, most of the time.
  To launch the server, open the terminal, run "cd server", then run "node server.js"

ExpressGenerator:
  This is a large but fairly simple folder containing code generated by an ExpressJS wizard.
  Most of the relevant code is contained in "app.js".
  We currently use index.js instead of the ExpressGenerator, but we should switch to the
    ExpressGenerator ASAP, if we decide to use it.

Jest Unit Tests:
  In the terminal, run "npm run test-server"
    
  After a brief period, it should show something like:
      PASS  __tests__/index.test.js
      Test the root path
        √ It should response the GET method (56 ms)
      Test /hello
        √ It should response the GET method (12 ms)

      Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
      Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
      Snapshots:   0 total
      Time:        1.559 s, estimated 7 s
      Ran all test suites.
  
  If this doesn't work, run the following commands, then try "npm test" again":
    npm install express
    npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env jest supertest superagent
  
  To create more tests:
    Go to "__tests_server__/index.test.js"
    Copy-paste new "describe" methods and follow the formatting from the ones that already exist.
    To find more functionality, go to https://jestjs.io/docs/expect.
